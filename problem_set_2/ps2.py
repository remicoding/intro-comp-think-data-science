    Parses the map file and constructs a directed graph

    Parameters:
        map_filename : name of the map file

    Assumes:
        Each entry in the map file consists of the following four positive
        integers, separated by a blank space:

        e.g.

    Parameters:

            Building number at which to end

            Represents the current path of nodes being traversed. Contains
            a list of node names, total distance traveled, and total

        max_dist_outdoors: int
            Maximum distance spent outdoors on a path
        best_dist: int
            The smallest distance between the original start and end node

        best_path: list of strings
            The shortest path found so far between the original start
